# CALLBACK PRACTICEand Real-World Questions
## 1. Website Analytics Data Collection
Problem:
You're building a website that tracks user interactions, like button clicks and page views, to understand how users engage with the site. The website needs to send this data to a server, but instead of sending it immediately after each interaction, it waits a few seconds to ensure that all data from a session is captured together.



## 2. Multiplayer Game: Coin Collection and Scoreboard
Problem:
Imagine you're developing a multiplayer online game where players race to collect as many coins as possible before time runs out. In this game, when a player collects a coin, it takes some time for the game to validate the collection and update the player's score.


## 3. Turn-Based Battle Game with Delayed Attacks
Problem:
You are designing a turn-based battle game where two players (Player 1 and Player 2) take turns attacking each other. Each player has a health bar, and an attack reduces the opponent's health by a random amount of damage. The battle continues until one player's health reaches zero, at which point the other player is declared the winner.


## 4. Real-Time Game Event Handler with Task Queue
Problem:
You're working on an online RPG where multiple events happen in real time, such as a player collecting resources, encountering enemies, and completing quests. These events often trigger at different times but need to be processed in a specific sequence to maintain game logic consistency.
